# ai-project

A chatbot with the OpenAI API that generates text and Dall-e images. 

It also has vision, and the images stay in the chat context, so you can ask follow-up questions about images. Vision and function calling work together so you can ask it to generate an image based on an image.

It also has a custom UI-modifying function as function calling.

## To do

- Features:

    - Set up a database

    - Add folders for organizing chats

    - Add a button for copying a message and other small useful features

- Styling:

    - Add a typing/loading animation
